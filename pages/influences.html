                <p>On this page, you will find further information on the relations Ada Lovelace had with different people including friends and family.</p>
                <p>Lord Byand was a famous poet, one of the leading figures of the romantic movement and the father of Ada Lovelace.</p>
                <p>A few months after her birth, Lord Byron divorced from Ada Lovelace's mother leaving her alone with their child, he died in 1824 when she was eight years old, Lovelace grew up with her mother telling her how depraved was his habits and explaining that he had mental problems.</p>
                <p>Ada Lovelace who grew up without her mother’s love (her mother letting the grandmother in charge of her child) she was scared of having her father's mental pathologies since her mother kept telling her that her dad was mean, depraved and unstable (she even hid his portrait from Ada Lovelace until she was 20).</p>
                <p>In fear of her child growing up to be like her father, her mother gave her a strict education and asked for her daughter to be taught mathematics and science.</p>
                <p>However, Ada Lovelace ended up with a lot of interest for her father’s works and she grew up with a fascination for him.</p>
                <p>Finally, she asked to, and ended up being buried next to her father’s grave after years of life fearing mental illnesses.</p>
                <p>Mary Somerville: she was a Scottish writer, mathematician and astronomer, she was in fact the first woman to integrate the royal astronomical society.</p>
                <p>Mary Somerville was also known for her progressive ideas (such as her disappointment on the accessibility of education for women and her protests against slavery).</p>
                <p>In 1819, she became Ada Lovelace's mathematics tutor and close friend, she invited her to scientific gatherings, taught her a lot of things and possibly influenced her a lot ; but above all, without Mary Somerville to invite her to these gatherings, Ada Lovelace wouldn’t have met Charles Babbage and possibly wouldn’t have contributed to science like she did.</p>
                <p>After a long life of studying science, doing researches, writing and helping, she died in Naples at the age of 91.</p>
                <p>Charles Babbage: He was a mathematician, a philosopher, an inventor and one of the founders of the astronomical society.</p>
                <p>He was known for his two inventions that unfortunately didn’t get to be entirely built due to a lack of funding (and organisation, Charles Babbage left his difference engine aside to start building its improved version, the analytical engine, which scared the people funding his projects).</p>
                <p>Charles Babbage worked with and became a close friend of Ada Lovelace whom he helped in her works and encouraged to publish her notes in her own name.</p>
                <p>He had a lot of respect for Ada Lovelace, proof can be found in his letter to Faraday (on the gender issue page), encouraging Ada Lovelace to continue her work while doctors told her that she was killing herself by overthinking helped Ada Lovelace keeping her head up.</p>
                <p>He died in 1871 and is now remembered as the inventor of the first computer while Ada Lovelace was the inventor of the first computer program, they were truly ahead of their time.</p>
