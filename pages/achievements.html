                            <p>In this part of our website we will focus on the technic aspect of her work. Focus on the analytical engine and what effect has her work on our today society.</p>
                            <p>Before talking with some technic terms, all the works that we will deal with in this page are not just made by Ada Lovelace, she was really influenced mainly by Babbage but by some others scientist as him.</p>
                            <p>Here is the Analytical Engine if it had ever been built. This only a picture what it could have been. This engine has never been built.</p>
                            <br>
                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="../img/toon-engine.jpeg" style="border: 2px solid #ffffff;" width="70%;">
                                </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>This is a huge engine that could have measured meter long and meter high. First, we can say that it has never been built because it would have cost so much money that all the investors never wanted to try to build it.</p>
                            <p>Now let’s talk more specifically. This engine can be compared in our modern society as a steam computer but also as the first computer ever imagine.</p>
                            <br>   
                                <div class="image">
                                    <img src="../img/engine-structure.jpg" style="border: 2px solid #ffffff;">
                                </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>The left side of the engine with all the gears is like the CPU or the processor of the engine. It is separated in two types: one side would have taken care of all the commands that would have been started (like numbers all stuff like that) and another side would have been used for calculation only, which means that it would have been able to do the four main calculation as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but also square root and compare.</p>
                            <p>As the first thing to interact with the engine, there are some card with hole in it that signify as an entrance peripheral. As the beginning of the calculation. This card would have been used as two types: one for the instructions that would have been understood by the “computer” and the result of this calculation.</p>
                            <p>All the result would have been storage in an internal memory, and it would have been able to store a thousand decimal number of forty numeral that would have represented 16.2 kilobyte.</p>
                            <p>That engine, in comparison, would have been able to calculate all the algorithm known today. But this is very theoretical.</p>
                            <p>Where Ada Lovelace revolutionized the thing is that she had been able to create an algorithm that can be understood by an engine. Every mathematician would have been able to do these algorithms but it would have taken hours of work. Ada Lovelace transformed these algorithms that only humans understood in mechanical algorithms.</p>
                            <p>We know that this may be hard to understand but Ada thought that she was able, with these algorithms, to let the engine create music, manipulate some symbols, even word and sentence, kind of a universal computer. That would have been insane at the time because we know that universal computer would have been really invented during the 30s.</p>
                            <p>She thought that the engine would have helped the human in what he wanted to do faster and better. She was not imagining and artificial intelligence that would have thought by itself.</p>
                            <p>She is well-known to have been the first informatician and in tribute for her work, modern informatician have created a programming language, which name is: Ada. It is used in more things that you could imagine, in our car for example, aeronautical technology or even in spatial technology. It is often used in real time system.</p>
                            <p>To conclude for her achievements we can say, only one sentence that would have resumed all her life. She has revolutionized her time and has impacted ours.</p>
