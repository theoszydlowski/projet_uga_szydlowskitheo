                <p>This video is a talk about women’s representation in history, Zoe Philpott takes Ada Lovelace as an example of how history wipes out women only to concentrate on men and their achievements.</p>
                <p>Basically, what Zoe Philpott tries to say is that, a lot of people know about Charles Babbage or the coding language Ada (page achievements) but few are the ones aware about Ada Lovelace's story, this video was the reason that pushed me to talk about Ada Lovelace at first, I wanted to talk about her, show to more people who she was instead of letting society wipe her out of history, like a lot of women before her. I may not be a woman, I think it is outrageous to only give credit to men, equality is something we should all fight for, everyone must stand up against injustices like these.</p>
                <p>Indirectly, Ada Lovelace did not only bring a lot to science, she also was an example to victims of systemic oppressions. A proof that everyone is capable of great things, she is now a symbol of gender equality.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, with feminist movements and people becoming more and more open minded, mainstream medias tend to pay tribute to women who didn’t have the chance by the past to get the credit they deserved after their hard work, here are two good examples:</p>
                <br>
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="../img/lovelacebabbage.jpg" style="border: 2px solid #ffffff;">
                    </div>
                <br>
                <p>Sydney Padua is an English author, animator and Artist who worked on different movies but she is mainly known for her comic book « The thrilling adventures of Lovelace and Babbage » which is a science fiction book based on true documents, the story takes place in an alternative reality where the analytical engine had been entirely built and then used to fight crime under the orders of Queen Victoria.</p>
                <p>In this book, we can see by the title and of course, the book's content, that Lovelace is put forward instead of being merely mentioned like she would have been in other creations.</p>
                <p>The fact that a woman is shown as being strong and intelligent in a mainstream comic book is a really good thing since it is something that is still rare nowadays, but it can ultimately bring more role models to young people who are still thinking about who they want to be.</p>
                <br>
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="../img/doctor.jpg" style="border: 2px solid #ffffff;">
                    </div>
                <br>
                <p>Another creation presenting Ada Lovelace to an even larger audience is the British science fiction drama Doctor who in which, Ada Lovelace appeared as a character with two other strong women ; Noor Inayat Khan a British spy during WWII who was the first female wireless operator sent to Paris during its occupation, a very dangerous and important mission at the time. Shortly after her arrival, the Nazis started a raid against wireless operators, forcing them to flee back to England, but she refused and quickly became the only wireless operator in Paris at the time. She was denounced and brought to a concentration camp at Dachau where she was tortured for months and months without giving away any information, Noor Inayat Khan was executed the 13th of September 1944.</p>
                <p>But once again, even if her story and her courage were unbelievable, the same thing happened to her that happened to Ada Lovelace, she was wiped out if history, nobody knows her although she did a lot against the Nazis. Here again, we have a woman who could inspire future generations of women, a perfect role model who was once again forgotten.</p>
                <p>The third strong woman to appear in this episode is fictional but is a proof of the evolution of mentalities, the Doctor, who is played by a woman for the first time after 13 different actors and 57 years is a strong leading female character, she has the main role in the series and by extension can become a role model for girls in a society where more than 80% of main characters in pop culture are men, making it impossible for most of girls to identify themselves with a character they like.</p>
                <p>This episode has the exact and honourable intention to showcase forgotten women of history, the exact thing that Zoe Philpott tried to push people to do in her Talk.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a conclusion on the topic of her impact on today’s world, I would say that one of the most revealing things in Ada Lovelace's case is that, she contributed to today’s society by inventing programs, by inspiring Turing and by extension, leading to today’s computers, phones, wireless connections, space programs and so on and so forth… but even with all this importance credited to her work, almost nobody knows her because she was a woman, in this patriarchal society that is ours, no matter how incredible or how important the things you do are, you will be forgotten because you are a woman.</p>
                <p>That's something that we should all think about, is this normal? Is it normal that nobody knows about the creator of the first program? Is it normal that nobody ever heard about a female war hero who showed so much courage and strength? Of course not, nobody should have to refrain themselves of doing something because of their sex or their gender, representation is something that we should all fight for, representation and equality.</p>
                <p>Ada Lovelace invented the first computer program, but she also became without knowing it, a model and an icon, she represents by who she was, the true natural equality but she also represents by who she became, the inequality present in our society.</p>
