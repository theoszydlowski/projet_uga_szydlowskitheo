                            9th of September 1843, letter from Babbage to Faraday, primary source

                <p>This document is an excerpt of a letter written by Charles Babbage to fellow physicist Michael Faraday in 1843 where he describes his assistant Ada Lovelace with whom he worked on his analytical engine.</p>
                <p>Here is a retranscription of what he wrote on his assistant: "That Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the most abstract of Sciences and has grasped it with a force that few masculine intellects (in our own country at least) could have exerted over it".</p>
                <p>Through these words, we have a proof that Charles Babbage had a strong friendship with Ada Lovelace whom he admired her dedication, her implication and her intellect.</p>
                <p>Something that is worth highlighting is that he compared her intelligence to that of a man which was something very rare and controversial at the time, but on top of that, he admitted and was proud of the fact that she even surpasses most of his fellow scientists. That alone defies her gender role, she excelled in a field that "shouldn't" be the one of a woman at the time.</p>
                <p>By contributing to science with huge advances such as her lines of code, she added her name to the list of women who helped breaking gender stereotypes, list which would include her friend Mary Somerville who was the first woman to enter the royal astronomical society.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, this document is known for being a proof of Charles Babbage's affection for Ada Lovelace and an unforgettable testimony and tribute to herself and her works.</p>
                <p>However, a proof of credibility being linked to gender still remains today, despite Ada Lovelace's notes (cf. biography on the main page) having been proved to be hers, some people just don’t want to admit that she could have possibly written those notes.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a 'bug' in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so."</p><p style="font-size: 20px;">Allan Bromley – Difference and analytical engine 1990</p>

                <p>Seeing this type of reasoning brings up some questions such as, how different things would have been at the time if more credit was put into women’s work instead of judging them by their gender? Things would have probably been very different, her notes might would have been entire books without being slowed down by her gender role, and, who knows, maybe someone would have funded the engine with more concrete examples of what could be achieved with such machinery.</p>
                <p>Ada Lovelace, in her private life, also suffered from the gender role that came with her sex at the time, she smoked, swore and was believed to manipulate and have extra conjugal sexual relations, things that were not acceptable for a woman at the time.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"But altough Ada had the mind to see the potential of computers over a century before one was even built, she still doesn't quite fit the mould of a tradtional science heroine.<br> Intelligent she might have been, but she was also manipulative and aggressive, a drug addict, a gambler and an adultress."</p><p style="font-size: 20px;">Not your typical role model: Ada Lovelace the 19th century programmer, by Hannah Fry - BBC</p>

                </div>
                <p>People often linked this behaviour to her father’s instability, leading her to think that she had a mental problem; On top of these problems, Ada Lovelace was still fragile, but she had to, like any other woman at the time, to do what was expected of her, to give birth of a few children and to take care of the house, which exhausted her, but since she was a woman, these activities were meant to be hers, so they were not the cause of her exhaustion, her work with Babbage was the cause, work which was meant to be the one of a man, those were the words of the people around her, a society forcing Ada Lovelace to stick to her gender role.</p>
