                            <p>This document is an excerpt of a letter written by Charles Babbage to fellow physicist Michael Faraday in 1843 where he describes his assistant Ada Lovelace with whom he worked on his analytical engine.</p>
                            <p>Here is a retranscription of what he wrote on his assistant: "That Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the most abstract of Sciences and has grasped it with a force that few masculine intellects (in our own country at least) could have exerted over it".</p>
                            <p>Through these words, we have a proof that Charles Babbage had a strong friendship with Ada Lovelace whom he admired her dedication, her implication and her intellect.</p>
                            <p>Something that is worth highlighting is that he compared her intelligence to that of a man which was something very rare and controversial at the time, but on top of that, he admitted and was proud of the fact that she even surpasses most of his fellow scientists. That alone defies her gender role, she excelled in a field that "shouldn't" be the one of a woman at the time.</p>
                            <p>By contributing to science with huge advances such as her lines of code, she added her name to the list of women who helped breaking gender stereotypes, list which would include her friend Mary Somerville who was the first woman to enter the royal astronomical society.</p>
                            <p>Nowadays, this document is known for being a proof of Charles Babbage's affection for Ada Lovelace and an unforgettable testimony and tribute to herself and her works.</p>
                            <p>However, a proof of credibility being linked to gender still remains today, despite Ada Lovelace's notes (cf. biography on the main page) having been proved to be hers, some people just donâ€™t want to admit that she could have possibly written those notes.</p>
