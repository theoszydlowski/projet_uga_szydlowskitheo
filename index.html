                                <p>Augusta Ada king, countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and science enthusiast.</p>
                                <p>She was born in 1815 and was the only child of Lord and Lady Byron but she, however, grew up without knowing her father, a famous English poet known (at the time) for his instability.</p>
                                <p>Ada Lovelace had a difficult childhood, her mother didn’t truly love her, her father had left shortly after her birth and her health worsen after she caught diseases after diseases, however, she grew up with a strong passion for science, mathematics and biology.</p>
                                <p>When she became a young woman, Ada Lovelace became close friends with Mary Somerville, a Scottish mathematician, writer and astronomer (who even became the first woman to enter the astronomical society) ; Mary Somerville introduced Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage in 1833, a famous mathematician and inventor who was ahead of his time, he invented the concept of programmable computers.</p>
                                <p>In 1835, Ada Lovelace married William, 8th Baron King with whom she had three children, one of them called after her father, Byron.</p>
                                <p>From 1840 to 1843, Ada Lovelace worked on Babbage’s analytical engine, helping him with notes, graphics and translation of documents related to his work (such as Luigi’s manebrea's article about the machine), her works mainly consisted of explaining the concept of the engine to everyone through thorough writings.</p>
                                <p>These writings, her skills and her fascination and implication on this device led Ada Lovelace to add notes to her writings, notes that are nowadays known as being the first computer programs.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, despite her writings being acclaimed within the scientific community and the engine having clear schematics, they lacked funding and their Analytical engine was never completed.</p>
                                <p>Ada Lovelace started gambling with the help of mathematics and equations to calculate probabilities but she lost a lot of money and ended up with a lot of debts, she fell sick and died in 1852 from uterine cancer at the age of 36 just like her father died ( Age wise, not in terms of death cause, obviously).</p>
